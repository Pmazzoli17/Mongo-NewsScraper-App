# Mongo-NewsScraper-App

This application is a personal news scraper app that allows users to scrape stories from google news.

It uses Cheerio to grab the site content and Mongoose to save it to the MongoDB database.

All users can leave notes on the stories that the app collects. They can also delete whatever notes they want removed. All stored notes are visible to every user.

You can check out a demo of the app below:
